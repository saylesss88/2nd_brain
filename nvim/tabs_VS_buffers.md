# Tabs VS Buffers

- **Buffers**: A buffer is a unit of memory where the contents of a file are
  stored.It's essentially the in-memory representation of a file. You can have
  multiple buffers open simultaneously.

- **Tabs**: A tab is a container for one or more windows. Each window can
  display a different buffer. Think of tabs as a way to organize multiple
  buffers together.

## Key differences:
- **Purpose**: Buffers are for storing file contents, while tabs are for
  organizing and managing multiple buffers.

- **Relationships**: Multiple buffers can be associated with a single tab, but
  a buffer can only be associated with one tab at a time.

- **Navigation**: You can switch between buffers using commands like `:bn`,
  `:bp`, and `:bl`. 

  To switch between tabs, use the `:tabn`, `:tabp` and `:tabnew` commands.

In essence:

    Buffers are the building blocks, holding the actual file content.
    Tabs are the containers that help you organize and manage those buffers.
