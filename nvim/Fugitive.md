# Commands

Using the `:Git` command, you can run any arbitrary git command from inside Vim.

At Vim's command line, the `%` symbol has special meaning: it expands to the 
full path of the current file.
- You can use it to run any git command that expects a filepath as an argument,
  making the command act on the current file.
