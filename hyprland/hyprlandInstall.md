# Launching Hyprland

Hyprland can be executed by typing `hyprland` in the terminal.

>[!Note] Do not launch Hyprland with `root` permissions (don't `sudo`)

Login managers are not officially supported, but here's a few:

- SDDM --> Works flawlessly. Install latest git version or `sddm-git`from AUR.

- GDM --> Works

- greetd --> Works flawlessly

## In Hyprland

You're good to go with your adventure technically.
