1. Check Hyprland Logs:

   Open a terminal and run journalctl -f -u hyprland to view Hyprland's logs. Look for any error messages related to the apps that aren't launching.

2. Verify Application Dependencies:

   Ensure that all necessary dependencies for the apps are installed. You can check this using your package manager (e.g., pacman -Qi <app_name>).
   If any dependencies are missing, install them using your package manager.

3. Check Hyprland Configuration:

   Make sure there are no conflicting settings or rules in your Hyprland configuration (~/.config/hypr/hypr.conf) that might be preventing the apps from launching.
   Try temporarily commenting out sections of your configuration to isolate the issue.

4. Try a Fresh Hyprland Installation:

   If the above steps don't resolve the issue, you can try reinstalling Hyprland. This might fix any corrupted configuration files or other underlying problems.

5. Check for Updates:

   Make sure your system is up-to-date, including Hyprland and any relevant dependencies.

6. Provide More Information:

   If you can provide more details about the specific apps that aren't launching, any error messages you're seeing, and your Hyprland configuration, it might help narrow down the problem.

Additional Tips:

    Try running the apps as root to see if they launch correctly. This can help rule out permission issues.
    Check the application's logs for any error messages that might provide clues about the problem.
    If you recently made any changes to your system or Hyprland configuration, try reverting those changes to see if the issue is resolved.
