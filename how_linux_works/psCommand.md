# ps command

For a quick listing of running processes, just run the `ps` command.
There are three different styles -- Unix, BSD, and GNU. Many people prefer the
BSD style..

Here are some of the most useful option combinations:

`ps x` Show all of your running processes.

`ps ax` Show all processes on the system, not just the ones you own.

`ps u` Include more detailed information on processes.

`ps w` Show full command names, not just what fits on one line.
