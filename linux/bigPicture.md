The most effective way to understand how an operating system works is through
*abstraction* -- ignoring most of the details that make up a piece that you're
trying to understand, and instead concentrate on its basic purpose and
operation.

- There are many terms for an abstracted subdivision in computer software --
  including *subsystem*, *module*, *component*, *function*, *method*, *class*.
