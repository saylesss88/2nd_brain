# Shell Scripts

The basic concept of shell scripts is a list of commands, which are linted in
the order of execution.

  - A good shell script will have comments that explain what it does.

  - Both shell scripts and functions are interpreted, meaning that they're not
    compiled.

  - They're both ASCII text that is read by the shell command interpreter.
