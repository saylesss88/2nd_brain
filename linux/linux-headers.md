# Linux-headers

Linux headers are a collection of header files that provide the necessary
information for programs to interact with the Linux kernel.

Think of them as a set of instructions that tell programs how to communicate
with the underlying system.

## Why are they important?

- Kernel Module Development: When you write a kernel module, you need the
  headers to access kernel functions and data structures.

- Compiling Kernel-Related Software: Certain software, like firmware or
  kernel-related tools, require the headers to compile correctly.

- Understanding Linux Kernel Internals: Developers and system administrators can
  use the headers to analyze kernel code and debug issues.
