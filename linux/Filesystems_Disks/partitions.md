**Partitions** are subdivisions of the whole disk.

    On linux, they're denoted with a number after the whole block device, just
    as it would an entire disk. 

    Partitions are defined on a small area of the disk called a partition table.

The Linux Logical Volume Manager (LVM) adds more flexibility to traditional disk
devices and partitions, and is now in use in many systems.

- The next layer up from the partition is the filesystem, the database of files
  and directories that you're accustomed to interacting with in user space.
