systemctl

 is a system utility that provides a user-friendly interface for managing systemd units, which are configuration files that describe various system services and processes. Systemd, in turn, is a system initialization manager and service manager used by many Linux distributions.

Here's a breakdown of how systemctl works:

    User Input: When you execute a systemctl command (e.g., systemctl start httpd), you are sending a request to the systemctl utility.
    systemctl Processes Request: systemctl interprets your command and determines the appropriate action to take.
    Systemd Interaction: systemctl then interacts with systemd to perform the requested action. Systemd is responsible for communicating with the kernel and managing system processes.
    Kernel Interaction: Systemd, as the system manager, interacts with the kernel to start, stop, or restart services, manage network interfaces, and perform other system tasks.
