# Virtual Terminals - TTY

Even if you have no terminal emulator running, several terminal sessions
continue to run behind the graphical desktop. Called _virtual terminals_ or
_virtual consoles_, they can be accesses by pressing CTRL+ALT+F1 through
CTRL+ALT+F6 on most systems. To switch from one virtual console to another,
press ALT and F1-F6.

- To return to the graphical desktop, press CTRL+ALT+F7
