# Move and Rename Files

The `mv` command allows you to move or rename files and directories depending on
how it's used. In either case, the original filename no longer exists after the
operation.

`mv item1 item2`    to move or rename file or directory item1 to item2 or

`mv item... directory` to move more items from one directory to another.
