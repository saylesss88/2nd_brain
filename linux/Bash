# How to Create and Execute Bash Scripts

By naming convention, bash scripts end with `.sh`. However they aren't required.

Bash scripts start with a `shebang`. Shebang is a combination of `bash #` and
`bang !` followed by the bash shell path. It tells the shell to execute it via
the bash shell. Shebang is simply an absolute path to the bash interpreter.

example:

```bash
sudo dnf install bash
```
