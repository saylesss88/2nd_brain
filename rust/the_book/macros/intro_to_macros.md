# Macros

Fundamentally, macros are a way of writing code that writes other code, which is
known as metaprogramming.

Three kinds of procedural macros:

- Custom `#[derive]` macros that specify code added with the derive attribute
  used on structs and enums
- Attribute-like macros that define custom attributes usable on any item
- Function-like macros that look like function calls but operate on the tokens
  specified as their argument
