# Projects, What I'm Working on Right Now

Projects have a couple of features that make them an ideal way to organize
modern work:

- First, they have a beginning and an end; they take place during a specific
  period of time and then they finish.
- Second, they have a specific, clear outcome that needs to happen in order for
  them to be checked off as complete.
