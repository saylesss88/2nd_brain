# How PARA Works

With the PARA system, every piece of information you want to save can be
placed into one of just four categories:

1. **Projects**: Short-term e orts in your work or life that youâ€™re working on
   now.
2. **Areas**: Long-term responsibilities you want to manage over time.
3. **Resources**: Topics or interests that may be useful in the future.
4. **Archives**: Inactive items from the other three categories.
