CODE: Capture; Organize; Distill; Express.

## Capture: Keep What Resonates

You can't consume every bit of the information stream.

We need to adopt the perspective of a curator, stepping back from the raging
river and starting to make intentional decisions about what information we want
to fill our minds.

Like a scientist capturing only the rarest butter ies to take back to the lab,
our goal should be to “capture” only the ideas and insights we think are truly
noteworthy.

The solution is to keep only what resonates in a trusted place that you control,
and to leave the rest aside.

By training ourselves to notice when something resonates with us, we can
improve not only our ability to take better notes, but also our understanding of
ourselves and what makes us tick.

Adopting the habit of knowledge capture has immediate bene ts for our
mental health and peace of mind. We can let go of the fear that our memory will
fail us at a crucial moment. Instead of jumping at every new headline and
notification, we can choose to consume information that adds value to our lives
and consciously let go of the rest.

## Organize: Save for Actionability

Once you’ve begun capturing notes with the ideas that resonate with you, you’ll
eventually feel the need to organize them.

The best way to organize your notes is to organize for action,
according to the active projects you are working on right now. Consider new
information in terms of its utility, asking, “How is this going to help me move
forward one of my current projects?

Organizing for action gives you a sense of tremendous clarity, because you
know that everything you’re keeping actually has a purpose. You know that it
aligns with your goals and priorities. Instead of organizing being an obstacle to
your productivity, it becomes a contributor to it.

## Distill: Find the Essence

Once you start capturing ideas in a central place and organizing them for action,
you’ll inevitably begin to notice patterns and connections between them.

There is a powerful way to facilitate and speed up this process of rapid
association: distill your notes down to their essence.

Every idea has an “essence”: the heart and soul of what it is trying to
communicate.It might take hundreds of pages and thousands of words to fully
explain a complex insight, but there is always a way to convey the core message in
just a sentence or two.

Every time you take a note, ask yourself, “How can I make this as useful as
possible for my future self?” That question will lead you to annotate the words
and phrases that explain why you saved a note, what you were thinking, and
what exactly caught your attention.

### Express: Show Your work

All the previous steps—capturing, organizing, and distilling—are geared toward
one ultimate purpose: sharing your own ideas, your own story, and your own
knowledge with others.

The word “productivity” has the same origin as the Latin verb producere, which
means “to produce.” Which means that at the end of the day, if you can’t point
to some kind of output or result you’ve produced, it’s questionable whether
you’ve been productive at all.
