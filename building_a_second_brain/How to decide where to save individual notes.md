# How to decide where to save individual notes

Once you’ve captured a batch of notes and it’s time to organize them, PARA
comes into play. The four main categories are ordered by actionability to make
the decision of where to put notes as easy as possible:

- Projects are most actionable because you’re working on them right now
and with a concrete deadline in mind.

- Areas have a longer time horizon and are less immediately actionable.

- Resources may become actionable depending on the situation.

- Archives remain inactive unless they are needed.

This order gives us a convenient checklist for deciding where to put a note,
starting at the top of the list and moving down:

1. In which project will this be most useful?
2. If none: In which area will this be most useful?
3. If none: Which resource does this belong to?
4. If none: Place in archives.

In other words, you are always trying to place a note or le not only where it
will be useful, but where it will be useful the soonest.

Instead of organizing ideas according to where they come from, I recommend
organizing them according to where they are going—speci cally, the outcomes
that they can help you realize.
