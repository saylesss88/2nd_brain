# What Not to Keep

In my experience, there are
four kinds of content that aren’t well suited to notes apps:

- Is this sensitive information you’d like to keep secure? The content
  you save in your notes is easily accessible from any device, which is great
  for accessibility but not for security. Information like tax records,
  government documents, passwords, and health records shouldn’t be saved
  in your notes.

- Is this a special format or le type better handled by a dedicated
  app? Although you could save specialized files such as Photoshop files or
  video footage in your notes, you’ll need a specialized app to open them
  anyway, so there’s no benefit to keeping them in your notes.

- Is this a very large file? Notes apps are made for short, lightweight bits
  of text and images, and their performance will often be severely hampered
  if you try to save large files in them.

- Will it need to be collaboratively edited? Notes apps are perfectly
  suited for individual, private use, which makes them less than ideal for
  collaboration. You can share individual notes or even groups of notes with
  others, but if you need multiple people to be able to collaboratively edit a
  document in real time, then you’ll need to use a different platform.
