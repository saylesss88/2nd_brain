# Organize -- Save for Actionability

## Organizing for Action: Where 99% of Notetakers Get Stuck

PARA : Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives.

- These four categories are universal, encompassing any kind of information,
  for any source, in any format, for any purpose.

- PARA can handle it all, regardless of your profession or eld, for one reason:
  it organizes information based on how actionable it is, not what kind of
  information it is.

- The project becomes the main unit of organization for your digital files.
  Instead of having to sort your notes according to a complex hierarchy of topics
  and subtopics, you have to answer only one simple question:
  "In which project will this be most useful?"

- The intention here is not to use a single software program, but to use a single
  organizing system, one that provides consistency even as you switch between apps
  many times per day

- A project will be the same project whether it's found in your notes app, your
  computer file system, or your cloud storage drive, allowing you to move
  seamlessly between them without losing your train of thought.
