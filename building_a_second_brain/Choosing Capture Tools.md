# Choosing Capture Tools

There are ways to automatically transfer text that you highlight from different
sources to your notes app.

- Capturing passages from ebooks: Most ebook apps make it very easy to
  highlight passages as you read. On Amazon Kindle, you can simply drag
  your finger across a sentence or paragraph you like to add a highlight.
  Then use the share menu to export all your highlights from the entire
  book all at once straight to your digital notes. You can also add comments
  right alongside the text as you read, which will help you remember what
  you found interesting about a passage.

- Capturing excerpts from online articles or web pages: When you
  come across an online article or blog post you want to read, save it to a
  “read later” app, which is like a digital magazine rack of everything you
  want to read (or watch or listen to) at some point. Whenever you have
  some free time (such as on breaks or in the evening after work), scroll
  through the articles you’ve saved and pick one to read. You can makehighlights,
  just as with ebooks, and they can also be automatically
  exported to your notes app using a third-party platform.

- Capturing quotes from podcasts: Many podcast player apps allow you
  to bookmark or “clip” segments of episodes as you’re listening to them.
  Some of them will even transcribe the audio into text, so you can export
  and search it within your notes.
