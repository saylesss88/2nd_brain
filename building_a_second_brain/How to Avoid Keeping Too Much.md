# How to Avoid Keeping Too Much

With any piece of content, the value is not evenly distributed.

Only extract the most salient, relevant, rich material and save it to a
succinct note.

- Don’t save entire chapters of a book—save only select passages.
- Don’t save complete transcripts of interviews—save a few of the best quotes.
- Don’t save entire websites—save a few screenshots of the sections that are
  most interesting.

Aim to capture no more than 10% of the original source.

The more economical you can be with the material you capture in the first place,
the less time and effort your future self will have to spend organizing,
distilling, and expressing it.

## Four Criteria for deciding what to keep

1. Does it inspire me?
   Keep a collection of inspiring quotes, photos, ideas, and stories and refer to
   them when you need inspiration or a fresh perspective.

2. Is It Useful?

3. Is It Personal?
   One of the most valuable kinds of information to keep is personal information
   —your own thoughts, reflections, memories, and mementos. Like the age-old
   practice of journaling or keeping a diary, we can use notetaking to document our
   lives and better understand how we became who we are.

4. Is It Surprising?
   Don't use your second brain to seek evidence that confirms what you already
   believe. If you're not surprised, then you already knew it at some level, so
   why take note of it? Surprise is an excellent barometer for information that
   doesn’t t neatly into our existing understanding, which means it has the
   potential to change how we think.
