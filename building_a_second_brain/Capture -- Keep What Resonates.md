# Capture -- Keep What Resonates

The meaning of a thought, insight, or memory often isnâ€™t immediately clear.
We need to write them down, revisit them, and view them from a different
perspective in order to digest what they mean to us.

We need an external medium in which to see our ideas from another vantage point,
and writing things down is the most effective and convenient one ever invented.
