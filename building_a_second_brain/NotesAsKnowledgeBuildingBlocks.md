# Rethinking Notetaking: Notes as Knowledge Building Blocks

For modern, professional notetaking, a note is a
“knowledge building block”—a discrete unit of information interpreted
through your unique perspective and stored outside your head.

By this definition, a note could include a passage from a book or article that
you were inspired by; a photo or image from the web with your annotations; or a
bullet-point list of your meandering thoughts on a topic, among many other
examples.

The length and format don’t matter—if a piece of content has been interpreted through
your lens, curated according to your taste, translated into your own words, or
drawn from your life experience, and stored in a secure place, then it qualifies as
a note.

A knowledge building block is discrete. It stands on its own and has intrinsic value,
but knowledge building blocks can also be combined into something much greater --
a report, an argument, a proposal, a story.
