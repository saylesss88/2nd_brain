# Twelve Favorite Problems

"You have to keep a dozen of your favorite problems constantly present in your
mind, although by and large they will lay in a dormant state. Every time you
hear or read a new trick or a new result, test it against each of your Twelve
problems to see whether it helps. Every once in a while there will be a hit,
and people will say, "How did he do it? He must be a genius""
