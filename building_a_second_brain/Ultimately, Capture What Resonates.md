# Ultimately, Capture What Resonates

When you use
up too much energy taking notes, you have little left over for the subsequent
steps that add far more value: making connections, imagining possibilities,
formulating theories, and creating new ideas of your own.

Our intuitive mind learns, and responds, even without conscious awareness. If
you listen to the intuition it will grow stronger, you'll start to hear it in
all kinds of situations.

- [!] You can intentionally train yourself to hear that voice
  of intuition every day by taking note of what it tells you.

It’s a good idea to capture key information about the source of a note, such as
the original web page address, the title of the piece, the author or publisher,
and the date it was published.III Many capture tools are even able to identify
and save this information automatically. Also, it’s often helpful to capture
chapter titles, headings, and bullet-point lists, since they add structure to
your notes and represent distillation already performed by the author on your
behalf.
