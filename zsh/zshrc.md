    bindkey '^[[3;5~' - This binds Ctrl + Super (usually the Windows key) to the kill-word function, deleting the current word.
    bindkey '^[[3~' - This binds the Delete key to the delete-char function, deleting the character behind the cursor.
    bindkey '^[[1;5C' - This binds Ctrl + Right Arrow to the forward-word function, moving the cursor forward by one word.
    bindkey '^[[1;5D' - This binds Ctrl + Left Arrow to the backward-word function, moving the cursor backward by one word.
    bindkey '^[[5~' - This binds PgUp to the beginning-of-buffer-or-history function, moving the cursor to the beginning of the current line or history.
    bindkey '^[[6~' - This binds PgDown to the end-of-buffer-or-history function, moving the cursor to the end of the current line or history.
    bindkey '^[[H' - This binds the Home key to the beginning-of-line function, moving the cursor to the beginning of the current line.
    bindkey '^[[F' - This binds the End key to the end-of-line function, moving the cursor to the end of the current line.
    bindkey '^[[Z' - This binds Shift + Tab to the undo function, undoing the last action.

Completion Features:

    autoload -Uz compinit - This loads the compinit function with extended options for zsh completion.
    compinit -d ~/.cache/zcompdump - This initializes completion and sets the cache directory to ~/.cache/zcompdump.
    The following lines configure various aspects of the zsh completion behavior, including menu style, descriptions, format of completion suggestions, and more.
    zstyle ':completion:*:kill:*' command 'ps -u $USER -o pid,%cpu,tty,cputime,cmd' - This configures the completion for the kill command to display additional information about running processes using the ps command.

Overall, this code snippet provides a good starting point for customizing your zsh experience with improved keybindings and enhanced completion features. You can further personalize it by adding additional keybindings or adjusting the zsh completion settings to suit your preferences.
