To use the `mcfly` command to search the terminal history:

1. To run the search, use the command `mcfly search <search string>`. 

```bash
mcfly search pacman
```

2. McFly enters full-screen mode. It displays the possible actions at the top
   along with a list of all items sorted from the most to least relevant.

3. When you have located the relevant entry, hit enter.

4. To edit the command before running it, locate the command following the same
   procedure, then select it using the TAB key. This pastes the selected command
   to the terminal.

5. To exit without running the command, hit escape.

6. To delete a command from the McFly database, choose the item and type F2.

7. To launch McFly without any search terms, use the `mcfly search` command. You
   can also use `mcfly search ""`
