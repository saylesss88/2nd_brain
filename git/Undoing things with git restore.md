It is entirely possible that you can be working with a “remote” repository that is, in
fact, on the same host you are. The word “remote” does not necessarily imply that
the repository is somewhere else on the network or Internet, only that it is
50elsewhere. Working with such a remote repository would still involve all the
standard pushing, pulling and fetching operations as with any other remote.
