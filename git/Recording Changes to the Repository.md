# Recording Changes to the Repository

Each file in your working directory can be in one of two states: *tracked* or
*untracked*.
- Tracked files are files that were in the last snapshot, as well as any newly
staged files; they can be unmodified, modified, or staged. Tracked files are 
files that Git knows about.

- Untracked files are everything else.

- When you first clone a repository, all of your files will be tracked and 
unmodified because Git just checked them out and you haven't made any changes.
