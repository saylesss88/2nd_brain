You’ve made a great start on the Happy Fun Books project, by setting up your bas
ic package structure and core Book type. When we get to a point like thiss in a so
ftwares project, it’s not always easy to know what to do next, or even more
importantly, what to do first.

## User Stories

- A great way to approach it is to think about it from the point of view of the
  users.

- An online bookstore, for example, will need to have certain features in order
  to be usable for its customers. People will need to see what books are available,
  see the details of any given book, and perhaps search for a book they’re interested
  in.

- [~] We sometimes call these user stories, because each of them tells a little
  story about a user and something they want to do.

- Sometimes people talk about features instead, but this doesn't necessarily
  make clear that all the work we do on the program should be aimed at interactions
  with users in some way.
