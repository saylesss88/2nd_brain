# What are the core stories

It's a good idea to think in terms of which _user stories_ you couldn't leave out.

For the bookstore to be usable at all, there are a few non-negotiable things users
need to be able to do such as:

1. Buy a book
2. List all available books
3. See details of a book

Identifying these core stories is a good way to think about any product.
It makes sence to focus on developing only the critical stories first.
