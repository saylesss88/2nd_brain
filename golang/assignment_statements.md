# Assignment Statements
#go

Unlike the `:=`, an assignment statement uses `=`, and it requires you to use 'var' and the data type after the variable name.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    var example string = "Gentle reminder"
    fmt.Printf("%s", example)
}

In this, we are saying that example is a variable of the type string, and we are assigning the string "Gentle reminder" to be stored in it.
```
