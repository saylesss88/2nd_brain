# Using Stow to clone setup

When you clone your configuration repository (managed with Stow and Git) to another computer, here's how to implement the same setup:

Prerequisites:

    Stow Installed: Ensure Stow is installed on the new computer. You can typically install it using your system's package manager.
    Git Installed: Make sure Git is also installed, as you'll be using it to interact with the cloned repository.

Steps:

    Clone the Repository:
        Use git clone <repository_url> (replace <repository_url> with the URL of your remote repository) to clone the repository containing your configuration files.

    Install Software (Optional):
        Depending on your configuration, you might need to install any specific software or tools used in your configurations (e.g., plugins for Neovim, fonts, etc.).

    Create Stow Directory (Optional):
        Stow typically uses /usr/local/stow by default, but you can create a different directory if desired.

    Create Symbolic Links:
        Manual Approach:
            Identify the directories containing your configuration files within the cloned repository (e.g., .dotfiles/zsh, .dotfiles/nvim, etc.).
            For each directory, use stow <directory_name> (replace <directory_name> with the actual directory name) to create symbolic links in your chosen Stow directory (e.g., /usr/local/stow).
        Stow with --target (Optional):
            If you want to place the symbolic links in a specific location other than the default Stow directory, you can use stow --target <target_directory> <directory_name>.
            Replace <target_directory> with the desired location for the symbolic links and <directory_name> with the actual directory name from the cloned repository.

    Verify Links (Optional):
        Use ls -l on the Stow directory (e.g., /usr/local/stow) to verify that the symbolic links have been created and point to the correct locations within the cloned repository.

    Source Configuration Files (Optional):
        Depending on your configuration, you might need to source specific configuration files (e.g., .zshrc). Refer to your configuration documentation for specific instructions.

Additional Considerations:

    Adjust Paths (If Necessary): If your configuration relies on specific paths on your original computer, you might need to adjust those paths slightly to work on the new system.
    Manual Configuration (Optional): Some configurations might require additional manual setup beyond just creating symbolic links. Refer to the documentation specific to your configuration tools (e.g., Neovim plugins) for any additional steps.

    Git documentation: https://git-scm.com/

By following these steps and considering the additional tips, you can effectively use your configuration repository (managed with Stow and Git) to set up your environment on another computer. Remember to adjust paths or configuration specifics as needed depending on your setup.
