# The Scrollback Buffer

`kitty` supports scrolling back to view history, just like most terminald. You
can use either keyword shortcuts or the mouse scroll wheel to do so. While you
are browsing the scrollback a small indicator is displayed along the right edge
of the window to show how far back you are.
